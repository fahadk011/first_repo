Reasons why you will not be able to replicate the study's findings using their GitHub repository?
Even though DeepMind put out a GitHub repo with the code and models, it’s not possible for us to fully 
redo the AlphaFold study. The main reason is the amount of computing power it needs — they used tons of 
GPUs/TPUs and trained the system for a long time, which we don’t have access to. It also depends on 
really big databases like UniRef and PDB that take a lot of storage and setup. On top of that,
a lot of their exact preprocessing steps, optimizations, and fine-tuned 
weights can’t easily be recreated without their setup. So, the GitHub repo lets us run predictions
with the pre-trained models, but we can’t retrain it ourselves or get the same results they did.
